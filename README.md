Problem Statement
Give a prompt to the user asking if they wish to create a new Savings Account or access an existing one.
If the user would like to create a new account, accept their name and initial deposit, and create a 5 digit random number and make it as the account number of their new Savings Account.
If they are accessing an existing account, accept their name and account number to validate the user, and give them options to withdraw, deposit or display their available balance.
